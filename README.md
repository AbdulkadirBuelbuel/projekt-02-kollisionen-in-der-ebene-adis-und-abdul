# Assignment #3 - Document scanning

## Task
Implement a document scanning application using Python and OpenCV. The application should load one image of a photographed paper document and then transform the image so that only the document is shown.
You can follow this [tutorial](https://learnopencv.com/automatic-document-scanner-using-opencv/), but use your own images as well as the [two given](./images/document01.jpg) [sample images](./images/document02.jpg).
Submit at least one new document image that show that the application works.
Write a short readme how to run the code and a brief explanation (max. 200 words, German or English).

## Rating
- Find or create at least one new appropriate image to demonstrate the application (1 point).
- Use a morphological operator to remove the text from the document (1 point).
- Implement a detection mechanism that finds the document corners (up to 4 points)
  - ALTERNATIV: implement a manual click version as in the tutorial, but you have to allow the user to click the corners in any order (up to 2 points).
- Image transformation so that only the document is visible (1 point)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented (up to 2 points)
- Readme is well written and contains all steps to install and run the code (1 point)
- BONUS: Code also works for the secret third image. (1 point)
- BONUS: Code also works for another secret image. (1 point)

## Acceptance criteria
- Push code (.py file) and readme.md file to the Github Classroom repository in time.
- Script runs without changes. One output image is generated.
- The code is written mainly on your own and any other source is mentioned in the code.
- All used AI tools are mentioned in the readme.md file.
- If two groups hand in the same or extremely similar solution, both groups do not pass the assignment.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
